# clothing-swap-route

## Goal
This repository aims to make the lives of the Dutch Clothing Loop managers easier by suggesting a logical route past all participating addresses of a clothing loop. 
The ordering in addresses should be made in such a way that none of the participants has to walk very far, preferably < 10 minutes.
