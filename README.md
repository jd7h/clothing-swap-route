# clothing-swap-route

## Goal
This repository aims to make the lives of the Dutch Clothing Loop managers easier by suggesting a logical route past all participating addresses of a clothing loop.
The ordering in addresses should be made in such a way that none of the participants has to walk very far, preferably < 10 minutes.

## Installation

This project is built using the programming language Python, specifically version 3. It contains a few dependencies outside of the
standard library of Python. The most easy way to install these dependencies is by using `pip` inside a Python _virtual environment_
or _venv_.

Please refer to the [documentation of `pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) on how to install `pip` on your operating system of choice.

1. Make sure you have a recent _clone_ of this repository (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/jd7h/clothing-swap-route`)
2. Create a Python _virtual environment_. How to do this [depends on your operating system](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-and-using-virtual-environments)`:
    * Linux/MacOS: `python3 -m venv venv`
    * Windows: `py -m venv venv`
    * This will create a new directory called `venv` that contains your freshly created virtual environment
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    * Linux/MacOS (with `bash`): `source venv/bin/activate`
    * Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Done!
